# Anilist-Downloader

JAR ver 1.0 release :
https://www.mediafire.com/file/hndbo2qnajpo1kl/AD.zip/file

java version: jdk-17.0.1 
required to run correctly.

How to run:
1. Extract file from rar
2. Double click .jar file in AnilistDownload_Build

Troubleshooting:
if jar doesn't run properly when double clicking:
- check java version is correct, could be using the wrong version if u have jdk and jre installed
- if still unsure try running from console, if you get a file not found error then make sure that the folder Nyaa-Magnet-Links is 1 directory before where u are running the program from. i.e. if you are trying to run through the console from the directory C:/Java/jdk-17.0.1/bin, then place Nyaa-Magnet-Links folder in C:/Java/jdk-17.0.1

Known issues:
both menus buttons, "refresh" and "get links" give error code 2 when clicked. (working on fix)
